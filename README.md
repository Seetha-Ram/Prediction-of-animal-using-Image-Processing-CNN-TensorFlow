# Prediction-of-animal-using-Image-Processing-CNN-TensorFlow
To start your Deep Learning Journey with Python, Cats vs Dog classification is the best fundamental Deep Learning project. In this project, we will create a model with the help of Python keras which will classify whether the image is of dog or cat.  About Cats and Dogs Prediction Project In this project, we will be using a Convolutional Neural Network to create our model which will predict whether the image is of dog or cat. We will create a GUI in which we will directly upload the image and predict whether the image contains a dog or cat.  Now, letâ€™s directly dive into the implementation of this project:  Dataset we will be using: In this we will be using the famous dataset that is the Asirra( animal species image recognition for restricting access) dataset, which was introduced in 2013 for a machine learning competition. The dataset consist of 25,000 images with equal numbers of cats and dogs.  You can download the Dogs and Cats dataset using the following link: Dogs and Cats Dataset  Project Prerequisites: You should firstly install all the required libraries in your system with the help of pip installer. The name of libraries you should install are:  Numpy Pandas Matplotlib Tensorflow Keras sklearn You can install this using pip by opening your cmd and type (For ex: pip install numpy, pip install tensorflow, pip install pandas, etc).
